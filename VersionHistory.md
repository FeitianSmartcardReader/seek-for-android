  * Pre-release
  * ICS support (Android-4.0.3)
  * compatible with SCAPI-2.3.0


### v2.3.0 ###
  * Compliant to the latest [SIMalliance](http://simalliance.org/) Open Mobile API Specification V2.02 (transport layer only)
  * SmartCard API is only based on the Open Mobile API SIMalliance
  * The namespace "android.smartcard" was completely removed
  * SmartCard API is only provided as shared library.


### v2.2.2 ###
  * SmartCard API is only provided as shared library.
  * SmartCard API is only based on the Open Mobile API [SIMalliance ](http://simalliance.org/)
  * The SmartCard API can be extended with the old API (V 1.X) with the backward compatibilty add on patch.
  * The permission for using the SmartCardAPI was changed from "android.permission.SMARTCARD" to "org.simalliance.openmobileapi.SMARTCARD".


### v2.2.1 ###
  * Fully compliant to the latest [SIMalliance ](http://simalliance.org/)Open Mobile API Specification (V1.01)
  * New SE Access Control Enforcer can restrict the access to Secure Elements by predefined policies. See the SE Access Control description.
  * CTS extension for SmartCard API. (Some corrections were made to enable CTS also for the shared library based SmartCard API)
  * Support of [ASSD](http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/ASSD/) to access SD memory cards with an embedded security system  (Note: The also provided ASSD kernel patch for creating the ASSD kernel driver has to be used for enabling the ASSD support)
  * The ASSD solution replaces the interim proprietary solution "MSC" for accessing a Secure SD cards.
  * SmartCard API is also provided as a shared library. A new alternative (but experimental) solution.
