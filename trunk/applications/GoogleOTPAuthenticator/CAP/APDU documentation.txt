APDU commands for Google OTP applet

Set counter/time:
Command:    00 10 00 00 08 DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD

Parameters: DD: data as a 64 bit unsigned Big Endian integer

Responses:
Success:    90 00
Errors:     67 00: wrong length - data length must be 8 bytes
            6A 80: wrong data - new counter value must be greater than or equal to the old one
            69 C0: no account selected

Sets the counter (HOTP mode) or the current time (TOTP mode) of the selected account to the given value (unsigned 64 bit Big Endian integer). The new value must be greater than or equal to the old value. The reason for this is that otherwise, an attacker could precompute passwords for a certain counter value or time and then reset the counter without the owner of the account noticing it.



Get counter/time:
Command:    00 11 00 00 00

Responses:
Success:    DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD 90 00
Errors:     69 C0: no account selected

Returns the value of the counter (HOTP mode) or the current time (TOTP mode) of the selected account as an unsigned 64 bit Big Endian integer.

            LE: length of email address, must be between 1 and 127
            EE: email address as a string of length LE
            SS: shared secret as a 20 byte binary string

Responses:
