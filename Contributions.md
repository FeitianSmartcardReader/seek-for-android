## Contribution Guidelines ##

### Introduction ###
We want to invite anyone to join the project and help improving it. There are many ways to participate like reporting bugs, writing documentation, creating/updating samples, helping on the mailing list or even contributing code and patches just to name a few.
However, like with any other open source project, certain policies define the process and requirements before a contribution gets accepted.

### Contributing to the project ###
Any SEEK related application, enhancement, bugfix or new code regarding the SmartCard API and its
subprojects is welcome.
Keep in mind that
  * License has to be Apache v2 - unless not applicable (e.g. kernel code is GPL)- indicated in the header of each source file
  * Copyright of patches has to be "Copyright XXXX Giesecke & Devrient GmbH." or "Copyright (c) XXXX, The Android Open Source Project" indicated in the header of each source file (to allow later contribution to AOSP)
  * Coding style has to meet AOSP requirements or the applicable project requirements
  * Language (variables, documentation, ...) has to be English
  * Support should be available for the contributed code when bugs are reported or Mailing List discussions arise
  * Contributing a new (sub)project also requires the creation of a Documentation in the Wiki
