The Advanced Security SD specification provided by the SD Association (www.sdcard.org) defines a standard for accessing an embedded secure element in an SD memory card. Detailed information about the ASSD can be found at http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/ASSD/. There you can also find a link to download the ASSD (simplified) specification.

The ASSD interface can only be implemented when there is a possibility to patch the operating systems, because the SD host functionality is part of the operating systems. On an API level, most operating systems only provide file system functionality and hide the low-level SD commands from the application developer.

If there is no possibility to use ASSD commands, the security functionality can be accessed using the additional filesystem based access that has been implemented in the cards, see [MSC SmartcardService](MscSmartcardService.md) for more details.
