= Introduction =

Devices from different manufacturers with different chipsets and kernel configurations do not always work in same way (although expected :)
This article collects the experience with different Android models.

===Android Dev Phone===
  * McEX support works by adding the kernel module
  * See [http://code.google.com/p/seek-for-android/wiki/HowToBuildKernel Flashing the kernel] how to enable McEX
  * Smartcard functionality will not work when no power cable was connected upon device boot. Also, removing the power cord while the system is running results in a blocked McEX device.<br/>Current investigations seem to indicate a power issue

===HTC Magic===
  * Equal to _Android Dev Phone_

===HTC Hero===
  * Currently untested

===Samsung Galaxy i7500===
  * McEX support works by adding the kernel module
  * See [http://code.google.com/p/seek-for-android/wiki/HowToBuildKernel Flashing the kernel] how to enable McEX
  * Smartcard functionality works independent of power/no power cord connection
  * *SEEK reference phone!*
