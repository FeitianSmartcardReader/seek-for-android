#summary Introduction to the shared library.

== Introduction ==

Since version 2.2.2 the !SmartCard API is offered as a shared library and replaced the previous !SmartCard API which was provided as SDK framework component. The shared library configuration allows the integration of the !SmartCard API into an android system without modifying the android SDK framework. This especially helps developers/system integrators (working on android system) who cannot or don't want to modify the SDK framework.



== The shared libraries of the !SmartCard API ==

The !SmartCard API offers two interfaces:
 * "OpenMobileAPI" (SCAPI V 2.X): The official API which is standardized in SIMalliance.
 * "!SmartcardClient" (SCAPI 1.X): The old API which is proprietary and just provided for backward compatiblity.



For both interfaces the !SmartCard API provides two dedicated shared libraries which can be used by applications:
 * The shared library "org.simalliance.openmobileapi" for the SIMalliance standardized interface "OpenMobileAPI".
 * The shared library "android.smartcard" for the proprietary interface "!SmartcardClient".
