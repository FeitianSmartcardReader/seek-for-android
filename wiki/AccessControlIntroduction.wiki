The access control scheme of the !SmartCard API is a protection mechanism to restrict Secure Element access. It can be ensured that only allowed Android applications are able to access specific Java Card applets depending on the APK certificate.

An additional APDU filter scheme (based on an APDU whitelist) is established to have a more detailed control over the access mechanism of an application.

The implementation relies on an extension of the handset integration in combination with a access control application running on the Secure Element.
