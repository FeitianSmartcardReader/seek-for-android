= Introduction =

For using th Android emulator with a real SIM or with a microSD card with integrated secure element, the emulator must be built from the modified emulator sources. 

== 1. UICC Support in Android Emulator ==

The Android emulator is only supporting a primitive 'fake' SIM card or SIM simulation which cannot be used to extend the Sim Toolkit framework or test the !SmartCard API.<br/>
On real devices, the RIL library is very restrictive in terms of STK support and needs to be extended but on the emulator a patch can be applied in order to provide full SIM access through the host PC/SC system.<br/><br/>
This extension enables the Android emulator to forward any APDU traffic (AT+CRSM, AT+CPIN, etc. commands) to a real SIM card that is connected through a PC/SC card reader and accessible with pcsc-lite running on the host. Additionally, this patch adds the missing support for the Sim Toolkit framework to the emulator's RIL implementation (reference-ril).

=== 1.1 Applying the patch to the android sources ===

  * Download the [http://seek-for-android.googlecode.com/files/smartcard-api-2_4_0.tgz smartcard-api-2_4_0.tgz] archive
  * Unpack the patch archive: <code>$ tar xvzf smartcard-api-2_4_0.tgz</code>
  * Apply the patches in the root folder of the Android source tree: <code>$ cd <ANDROID_ROOT_DIR><br/>
$ patch -p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/smartcard-api.patch<br/>
$ patch -p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/uicc.patch
$ patch -p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/emulator.patch</code>
 * Download and build pcsc-lite from the official Internet sources. (It is recommended to use the sources since we have encountered problems with the pcsc-lite package maintained by the package installer of the Linux distribution especially if your host is a 64bit system.) <code>
$ tar xvjf pcsc-lite-<version>.tar.bz2
$ cd <path/to/pcsc-lite>
$ ./configure; make</code>
 * Setup build environment: <code>
$ cd <ANDROID_ROOT_DIR>
$ . build/envsetup.sh 
$ lunch full-eng
</code>
 * Update current.xml as the system needs to known the new IDs (if not already done): <code>
$ make update-api
</code>
 * Build the emulator with PC/SC support within the product SDK: 
 In case of problems that the build system cannot find the proper include & lib files, specify them manually: <code>
$ PCSC_INCPATH=/path/to/PCSC/src/PCSC PCSC_LIBPATH=/path/to/PCSC/src/.libs mm -j2 PRODUCT-sdk-sdk
</code>
 * The sdk can then be found at <code>
<ANDROID_ROOT_DIR>/out/host/linux-x86/sdk/
</code>

 * Start SDK Manager with: <code>
$ ./out/host/linux-x86/sdk/android-sdk_eng.<username>_linux-x86/tools/android
</code> The full path name is necessary since you might have also an offical installation of the Android SDK.

 * If you want to develop applications using the Smartcard API the shared library approach is recommended. Therefore your self compiled sdk
needs the Smartcard API addon which can be found at <code>
http://code.google.com/p/seek-for-android/source/browse/trunk/repository/addon.xml </code> The download of the addon within your selfcompiled SDK Manager will most likely cause an update of the SDK Tools, which means your compiled emulator will be replaced by the Google version. Therefore it is recommended to use a separate Android SDK e.g. the official Version to download the addon and then copy it to your own SDK. The addons are located here <code><ANDROID_ROOT_DIR>/out/host/linux-x86/sdk/android-sdk_eng.<username>_linux-x86/add-ons</code>

 * Create an AVD with behalf of the AVD Manager "Tools->Manage AVD's..."

 * Start the emulator <code>
$ ./out/host/linux-x86/sdk/android-sdk_eng.schusteh_linux-x86/tools/emulator @testAvd -pcsc </code>

 * The SIM must be already inserted in the used PC/SC reader before launching the emulator.
 * In the emulator output a card reader will get listed, e.g. _sim_card.c: using card reader Cherry XX44 00 00_

* If you want to start the emulator from the eclipse ide you have to add the command line parameter "-pcsc" via Run>Debug Configurations/Run Configurations<br/>

== 2. ASSD Support in Android Emulator (for microSD with integrated secure element) ==

Enabling ASSD support in the Android emulator, allows to access a Secure SD Card with integrated Secure Element by using the ASSD interface (Advanced Security SD specification). Therefore it is required to additionally enable both, the kernel of the emulator and the kernel of the Host-PC with ASSD support.

=== 2.1 Enabling ASSD Support in Android Emulator ===

  * Retrieve the kernel source for the emulator
{{{
$ git clone https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/goldfish
The repository is created in the subdirectory 'goldfish'
$cd <GOLDFISH_DIR>
<GOLDFISH_DIR>$git checkout android-goldfish-2.6.29 
}}}

  * Apply the patch 
The patch can be extracted from the  [http://seek-for-android.googlecode.com/files/20110715-assd-kernel.tar.gz 20110715-assd-kernel.tar.gz] 
{{{
<GOLDFISH_DIR>$ patch -p1 < assd_kernel.patch
}}}

  * Build the kernel
{{{
<GOLDFISH_DIR>$export ARCH=arm
<GOLDFISH_DIR>$export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-
<GOLDFISH_DIR>$export PATH=<PATH_TO_ANDROID_SOURCE>/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin:$PATH
<GOLDFISH_DIR>$make goldfish_defconfig
<GOLDFISH_DIR>$make    
}}}

Once finished, the following message occurs
_'Kernel: arch/arm/boot/zImage is ready'_

=== 2.2 ASSD Support in Host-PC ===

*Note:* The ASSD support requires an SD-Card slot with SD-Card controller on your host. It will not work with SD-Card readers connected via USB. 

  * Create a custom specific kernel for your Host-PC by adding the ASSD-Patch (e.g. patch  the for Kernel 2.6.32 when you use Ubuntu 10.04).
  * The patch to enable ASSD in the kernel of the host is identical to the patch applied to the emulator kernel source. 
  * Once the kernel of the host is replaced, ensure that you have enough rights to access the device node /dev/assd.

=== 2.3 Run the emulator with ASSD Support ===

 * Create an AVD and launch the emulator:
{{{
android create avd -n myAndroid2.3 -t 1 -c 10M
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=<path/to/android-sdk-linux> ./out/host/linux-x86/bin/emulator    
    -avd myAndroid2.3 -system out/target/product/generic/system.img 
    -kernel goldfish/prebuilt/android-arm/kernel/zImage
}}}
 * The microSD must be already inserted in the SD Card-Reader before launching the emulator.
 * In the emulator output there will information shown regarding the status of ASSD support, e.g. _goldfish_mmc: ASSD is ready goldfish_mmc: ASSD available_


== 3. Command line interface ==
After the emulator extensions patch is applied, these command-line options are available to the emulator.
{{{
Option                    Description
-pcsc <terminal name>     Enable access to a SIM card inserted to a PC/SC card reader. If <card reader's name> is
                          omitted the emulator outputs a list of card reader names and uses the first card reader
                          from that list.

-no_dns                   Workaround for running the emulator on a host without configured DNS thus without network
                          connectivity.
}}}
