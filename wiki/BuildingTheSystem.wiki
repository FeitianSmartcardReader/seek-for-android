#summary How to compile the Android sources with !SmartCard API and SCWS support

= Introduction =

This documents describes how to build the system from scratch, apply the smart card related patches and flash a development device with the new images.


== Getting the Android sources ==

A more detailed description how to set up the local work environment can be found  [http://source.android.com/source/download.html here].
{{{
$ repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git -b froyo
$ repo sync
}}}
<br/>

== Patching the sources ==
Apply the necessary patches in the root directory of the Froyo source code to enable smart card support.<br/>
Please make sure what patches should be applied. We separated the different use cases (!SmartCard API, SCWS/BIP, PC/SC) into different download packages.

===== !SmartCard API support =====
Download the [http://seek-for-android.googlecode.com/files/smartcard-api_1.1.tgz smartcard-api_1.1.tgz] patch and extract the content:
 * `smartcard-api.patch` - patches the Java sources for !SmartCard API support
 * `uicc.patch` - patches the Android Telephony framework with the required UICC methods for the !SmartCard API UiccTerminal support
 * `emulator.patch` - patches the qemu module to support the PC/SC UICC from the host system instead of the (standard) SIM simulator

===== Smart Card Web Server support =====
Download the [http://seek-for-android.googlecode.com/files/smartcard-webserver_1.0.tgz smartcard-webserver_1.0.tgz] patch and extract the content:
 * `scws.patch` - patches the Java sources for BIP and Smart Card Web Server support
 * `emulator.patch` - patches the qemu module to support the PC/SC UICC from the host system instead of the (standard) SIM simulator

===== PC/SC support =====
Download the _todo_ patch and extract the content:
 * `system_service.patch` - patches the Java sources with a system service for native access
 * `pcsc-lite.patch` - patches external/pcsc/pcsc-lite with PC-SC support
 * `ifdhandler.patch` - patches external/pcsc/ifdhandler with native IFD Handler support

===== Apply the patches and update the API =====
{{{
$ cd <ANDROID_FROYO_ROOT_DIR>
$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/smartcard-api_1.1/smartcard-api.patch
$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/smartcard-api_1.1/uicc.patch
$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/smartcard-api_1.1/emulator.patch

$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/smartcard-webserver_1.0/scws.patch
Optional:
$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/smartcard-webserver_1.0/emulator.patch

$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/pcsc-interface_1.0/system_service.patch
$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/pcsc-interface_1.0/pcsc-lite.patch
$ patch –p1 < <path_to_my_patches>/pcsc-interface_1.0/ifdhandler.patch

$ make update-api
}}}
<br/>

== Building the system ==
Compile the sources for the target device (e.g. replace `passion` with `sapphire` or `dream` depending on your device)
{{{
$ cd device/htc/passion
$ ./unzip-files.sh
$ cd -
$ TARGET_PRODUCT=full_passion make
}}}
Make sure to have downloaded the correct ZIP archive for `unzip-files.sh`, if unsuccessful attach the device and run `extract-files.sh` or search the Internet for more information how to build the system for a real device.
<br/><br/><br/>

== Flashing the phone ==
*Note: You'll loose all data on the phone if you proceed*<br/>
To flash the phone, execute:
{{{
$ ./out/host/linux-x86/bin/adb reboot bootloader
$ ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT=out/target/product/passion ./out/host/linux-x86/bin/fastboot –w flashall
}}}
If `flashall` fails you might also try:
{{{
$ ./out/host/linux-x86/bin/fastboot flash boot out/target/product/passion/boot.img
$ ./out/host/linux-x86/bin/fastboot flash system out/target/product/passion/system.img
$ ./out/host/linux-x86/bin/fastboot flash userdata out/target/product/passion/data.img
}}}  
<br/>

== Building the SDK and documentation ==
As the new system image running on the phone now contains an extended framework API, these changes need to be included in the SDK as well.<br/>
Run a
{{{
$ make sdk
$ make docs
}}}
to find the new SDK under `out/host/linux-x86/sdk` and the offline documentation under `out/target/common/docs/offline-sdk/reference`
