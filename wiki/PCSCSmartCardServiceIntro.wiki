#summary PCSC Support for SmartCard API

= Introduction =

To provide the PCSC Interface on the Android device, additional to the !SmartCard API, we implemented a smartcard reader driver (ifdhandler) for PCSC-Lite, which routes the APDU communication through a !SmartCard system service to the !SmartCard API. PCSC Support for the !SmartCard API is an optional component which is typically not required, as the !SmartCard API already allow to communicate with any Secure Element. 
But the PCSC-Interface is the standard interface used for many PC applications accessing smartcards. So this implementation will provide the PCSC interface for already existing native applications (e.g. OpenSC), which are ported to Android and requiring the PCSC interface.
Whenever possible, it is recommended to directly use the !SmartCard API.

= Details =

The current version (v094) of the ifdhandler is a prototype, which allow to route the APDU communication from the PCSC interface to the !SmartCard API.
