#summary PCSC Support for SmartCard API

= Introduction =

To provide the PCSC Interface in additional to the SmartCard API, we implemented a smartcard reader driver (ifdhandler) for PCSC-Lite, which routes the APDU communication through a SmartCard system service to the SmartCard API. Whenever possible, it is recommended to directly use the SmartCard API.
But the PCSC-Interface is the standard interface used for many PC applications accessing smartcards. So this implementation will provide the PCSC interface for already existing native applications requiring the PCSC interface.


= Details =

The current version (v093) of the ifdhandler is a first prototype, which opens a basic channel from the SmartCard API and routes all commands to this channel.
Typical smartcard applications do not use logical channels, so this is the adequate solution to provide access to the smartcard for typical smartcard applications.
For UICC the situation is different, as in real phones, the basic channel is mostly exclusively used by the baseband controller.
