== Bearer Independent Protocol (BIP) ==

== Introduction ==

Modern (U)SIM cards have been enhanced by many more functionalities than simple user authentication. One of those enhanced functionalities is the smart card web server (SCWS).
The SCWS delivers web pages using the HTTP protocol. These web pages (e.g. the phone book) can be shown within the mobile phone's web browser, and so offer an enhanced user experience to the mobile phone user. 

These data is transported between browser and UICC via Bearer Independent Protocol.

Basically BIP consists of five proactive commands (OPEN CHANNEL, CLOSE CHANNEL, SEND DATA, RECEIVE DATA and GET CHANNEL STATUS) and two events (Data available and channel status).
It allows the UICC to exchange data to a remote Server in the Network or serve data to a local browser.

This BIP extension patch based on a proof of concept which enabled the SCWS for Android. With the aid of ST Ericsson the SCWS patch was re-designed and extended to the BIP extension.

== Features ==

  * Enables Android to support BIP with default (network) bearer and BIP in server mode.

  * Supports BIP client with TCP/UDP connection (local and remote).

  * Supports BIP in TCP Server mode.

  * Extends the STK framework with support of the STK commands SET_POLL_INTERVAL, SET_UP_EVENT_LIST, OPEN_CHANNEL, CLOSE_CHANNEL, SEND_DATA, RECEIVE_DATA and GET_CHANNEL_STATUS.

  * Supports CHANNEL_STATUS and DATA_AVAILABLE Event with crosscheck to event list provided by SET-UP-EVENTLIST. 

  * Opens data connections in PDP context.


== Restrictions ==

  * Supports only IPv4 connections.
  * Only immediate link establishment is supported not background or on-demand.
  * Alpha identifier is currently only supported for OPEN_CHANNEL, and not for CLOSE_CHANNEL or SEND/RECEIVE_DATA.
  * No support for Other Address (Local Address) TLV in OPEN_CHANNEL, value will if present be ignored and no Local Address TLV will be included in the TERMINAL_RESPONSE either.
  * Baseband has to support multiple PDP.
  * Runs currently only in Emulator, if you don't have a baseband which forwards the BIP STK commands.

You need to extract the archive, then you will get three patches to be applied to the android sources.

  1. STK enabling patch. This patch is optional it is necessary to enable STK support within android. You don't have to apply this patch if you already use the STK application in Android.

Apply patch with
{{{
patch -p1 -i bip-extensions-stk-0_9.patch
}}}

  2. STK Application patch (mandatory). This patch extends the STK application packages with code for user interaction (e.g. confirming OPEN CHANNEL command.)

Apply patch with
{{{
patch -p1 -i bip-extensions-apps-0_9.patch
}}}

  3. STK framework patch (mandatory). This patch contains almost all functionality of the BIP extension.

Apply patch with
{{{
patch -p1 -i bip-extensions-frameworks-0_9.patch
}}}


within the root directory of your android source.

== Environment ==
  * Built and developed on Android 2.3.5_r1.
  * Emulator extension patch from SmartCardAPI 2.2.2.


== Further Information ==

The radio interface layer (RIL) must support BIP. On current Android phones, the RIL does not support BIP.

For this reason the bip extension patch includes an emulator extension (emulator.patch), which adds BIP support to the emulator's RIL (reference-ril). See [wiki:EmulatorExtensions EmulatorExtension] for how to build the emulator with extensions. 


This BIP extensions based on the SCWS extensions which needed BIP to exchange data with the browser and a remote admin server.
Therefore the classes named with prefix SCWS are renamed with the prefix Bip (e.g. SCWSProxy -> BipProxy).


== Using SCWS ==
The bip extension patch enables support for SCWS to the Android framework. Once the patches have been applied, web pages on an SCWS enabled SIM card can be accessed under the URL http://localhost:3516/.
