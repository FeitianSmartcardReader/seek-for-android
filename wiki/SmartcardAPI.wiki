#summary How to use the Smartcard API in Android

= Introduction =

The Smartcard API is a proposal for an implementation of a library that will enable Android applications to connect a Secure Element, e.g. USIM card or Mobile Security Card or others.<br/><br/>
The interface of the library should be considered as stable and independent of the underlying transport mechanism as the developer using the library is only interested in the interface.<br/><br/>


== smartcard-api modules ==

The smartcard-api consists of several modules
  * *SmartcardService* Android remote service as the core of the smart card access<br/>Integration in `frameworks/base/packages/SmartcardService`
  * *SmartcardClient* Wrapper classes to hide the service binding specifics and deal as the main interface for the application developer<br/>Integration in `frameworks/base/core/java/android/smartcard`
  * *PcscJni* JNI interface for the service to connect to the pcsc-lite daemon<br/>Integration in `frameworks/base/libs/pcsc`

== Using the smartcard-api ==
Download and apply the `smartcard-api.patch` according to [http://code.google.com/p/seek-for-android/wiki/BuildingTheSystem Building building the system]<br/>
When using Eclipse as the development environment update the SDK location to point to the correct SDK.<br/>
Open the samples and run them on the phone. They provide a good starting point about how the smart card library can be used.<br/>
