#summary Support for EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA in Android.
= Introduction =
EAP-SIM is a mechanism for authentication and session key generation using a GSM authentication algorithm on client and network sides.
EAP-AKA is like EAP-SIM but uses the authentication algorithms on an USIM.

EAP-SIM is specified in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4186 RFC 4186].

EAP-AKA is specified in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4187 RFC 4187].

Specifications about EAP can be found [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748 here] and [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5247 here].

An overview how a WLAN with EAP authentication may look like is shown below:

To run an EAP-SIM/AKA authentication you will need a client as wpa_supplicant which has access to a (U)SIM. 
The WLAN access point on the network has to support EAP (which is often transcribed as WPA(2)-RADIUS or WPA(2)-ENTERPRISE). The WLAN AP has to have access to a RADIUS server who handles the authentication and session key generation. The RADIUS server needs for EAP-SIM/AKA in a productive environment access to the home location register (HLR) of the MNO where the (U)SIMs are registered. For testing a file with precreated values for authentication is sufficient.

The next picture shows simplified the data flow during the authentication process.
