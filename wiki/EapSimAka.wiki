#summary Support for EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA in Android.
= Introduction =
EAP-SIM is a mechanism for authentication and session key generation using a GSM authentication algorithm on client and network sides.
EAP-AKA is like EAP-SIM but uses the authentication algorithms on an USIM.

EAP-SIM is specified in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4186 RFC 4186].

EAP-AKA is specified in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4187 RFC 4187].

Specifications about EAP can be found [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748 here] and [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5247 here].



= Details =
An overview how a WLAN with EAP authentication may look like is shown below:

To run an EAP-SIM/AKA authentication you will need a client as wpa_supplicant which has access to a (U)SIM. 
The WLAN access point on the network has to support EAP (which is often transcribed as WPA(2)-RADIUS or WPA(2)-ENTERPRISE). The WLAN AP has to have access to a RADIUS server who handles the authentication and session key generation. The RADIUS server needs for EAP-SIM/AKA in a productive environment access to the home location register (HLR) of the MNO where the (U)SIMs are registered. For testing a file with precreated values for authentication is sufficient.

The next picture shows simplified the data flow during the authentication process.

== Changes to Android ==

In order to run EAP-SIM/AKA on a Android smartphone it is necessary to adapt two parts of the sources:
- the wpa_supplicant and
- the Settings.apk

To get access to the (U)SIM it is necessary to enable the PC/SC interface and integration the SmartCard API with UICC support. 
The EAP-SIM/AKA patch was tested against Android 2.3.4_r1, the SmartCard API 2.2.1 and the PCSC System Service 0.9.6.

=== wpa_supplicant ===
For the wpa_supplicant the use of the PCSC interface has to be enabled and the functions which encapsulate 
the PCSC interface have to be adapted so that they can handle the responses form the SmartCardService.
Since the original sources of the wpa_supplicant expected responses from the (U)SIM according to the T=0 protocol, 
but the SmartCardService returns response data according to T=1.

=== Settings.apk ===
To give the user the possibility to enable EAP-SIM or EAP-AKA on his Smartphone it is necessary to extend the WiFi Dialog
where it is possible to select the EAP methods.
The WiFi Dialog is located in the package Settings.apk. 
Now the entries `SIM` and `AKA` are now availabel and selectable as EAP-Method. 
When selecting `SIM` or `AKA` the other fields like `Phase 2 Authentication`, `CA-Cerificate` and so on can be left empty 
or by their default values.

=== Patch ===
Download the [http://seek-for-android.googlecode.com/files/eap-sim-aka-0.4.tgz EAP-SIM/AKA patch] and extract the content.

Apply the patch with
{{{
patch -p1 -i eap-sim-aka-0.4.patch
}}}
in the root directory of your Android Sources.
